o365beat:
  ## period defines how often API is polled for new content blobs
  ## 5 min default, as new content (probably) isn't published too often
  # period: 5m

  # period Defines how often API is polled for new content blobs
  # 5 min default, as new content (probably) isn't published too often
  # period: 5m

  # api_timeout Defines how long the beat will wait for responses from the API
  # 30 second default; extend this for busy tenants
  # api_timeout: 30s

  # content_max_age Defines the oldest content the beat will request
  # 7 day default, which is the max retained according to Microsoft
  # reduce this for busy tenants to minimize risk of timeouts
  # content_max_age: 168h

  ## pull secrets from environment (e.g, > set -a; . ./ENV_FILE; set +a;)
  ## or a key store (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/keystore.html)
  ## or hard-code here:
  tenant_domain: ${O365BEAT_TENANT_DOMAIN:}
  client_secret: ${O365BEAT_CLIENT_SECRET:}
  client_id:     ${O365BEAT_CLIENT_ID:}     # aka application id (GUID)
  directory_id:  ${O365BEAT_DIRECTORY_ID:}  # aka tenant id (GUID)
  registry_file_path: ${O365BEAT_REGISTRY_PATH:./o365beat.state}

  ## the following content types will be pulled from the API
  ## for available types, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference#working-with-the-office-365-management-activity-api

    - Audit.Exchange
    - Audit.SharePoint
    - Audit.General
    # - DLP.All # TODO: figure out what to do with this, it's not like the rest

## By default, map Office 365 Activities API event fields to ECS fields
## API "Common" fields: Id, RecordType, CreationTime, Operation, OrganizationId,
##                      UserType, UserKey, Workload, ResultStatus, ObjectId,
##                      UserId, ClientIP, Scope
